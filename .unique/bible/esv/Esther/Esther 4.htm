She sent garments to clothe Mordecai, so that he might take off his sackcloth, but he would not accept them.</span> <span id="en-ESV-12768" class="text Esth-4-5"><sup>5 </sup>Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, who had been appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mordecai to learn what this was and why it was.</span> <span id="en-ESV-12769" class="text Esth-4-6"><sup>6 </sup>Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king's gate,</span> <span id="en-ESV-12770" class="text Esth-4-7"><sup>7 </sup>and Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, <sup class='crossreference'  data-link='(&lt;a href=&quot;#cen-ESV-12770D&quot; title=&quot;See cross-reference D&quot;&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;)' data-cr='#cen-ESV-12770D'></sup>and the exact sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.</span> <span id="en-ESV-12771" class="text Esth-4-8"><sup>8 </sup>Mordecai also gave him <sup class='crossreference'  data-link='(&lt;a href=&quot;#cen-ESV-12771E&quot; title=&quot;See cross-reference E&quot;&gt;E&lt;/a&gt;)' data-cr='#cen-ESV-12771E'></sup>a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her and command her to go to the king to beg his favor and plead with him on behalf of her people.</span> <span id="en-ESV-12772" class="text Esth-4-9"><sup>9 </sup>And Hathach went and told Esther what Mordecai had said.</span> <span id="en-ESV-12773" class="text Esth-4-10"><sup>10 </sup>Then Esther spoke to Hathach and commanded him to go to Mordecai and say,</span> <span id="en-ESV-12774" class="text Esth-4-11"><sup>11 </sup>“All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside <sup class='crossreference'  data-link='(&lt;a href=&quot;#cen-ESV-12774F&quot; title=&quot;See cross-reference F&quot;&gt;F&lt;/a&gt;)' data-cr='#cen-ESV-12774F'></sup>the inner court without being called, <sup class='crossreference'  data-link='(&lt;a href=&quot;#cen-ESV-12774G&quot; title=&quot;See cross-reference G&quot;&gt;G&lt;/a&gt;)' data-cr='#cen-ESV-12774G'></sup>there is but one law—to be put to death, except the one <sup class='crossreference'  data-link='(&lt;a href=&quot;#cen-ESV-12774H&quot; title=&quot;See cross-reference H&quot;&gt;H&lt;/a&gt;)' data-cr='#cen-ESV-12774H'></sup>to whom the king holds out the golden scepter so that he may live.
